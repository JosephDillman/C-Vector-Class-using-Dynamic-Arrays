# C-Vector-Class-using-Dynamic-Arrays
For this classes/objects project in C++ I mimicked the "Vector" library by creating a class involving dynamic arrays. The class member functions also mimic the Vector functions such as push_back(double i), resize(int i), value_at(int i), as well as overloaded "=" and "==" operators. Basic constructors and destructors are included as well.

VectorDouble.h is the header file
VectorDouble.CPP is the implementation file 
clientcode.cpp includes the main funtion which contains a scripts to show off the class working properly
run will run the compiled clientcode.cpp
